# Ferrium Implementation Status

## Beta Release - Feature Complete with Production Testing

Ferrium is a well-tested distributed KV storage system built with Rust and openraft. With comprehensive TLS/mTLS support, successful 3-node cluster testing, and robust auto-join functionality, this is a beta-stage project ready for production evaluation and non-critical deployments.

## Working Features

### Core Distributed System

-  Persistent Storage: RocksDB-based storage with snapshots 
-  Dynamic Membership: Basic add/remove nodes functionality
-  Leader Election: Automatic leader selection works in testing
-  Basic State Machine: In-memory cache with disk persistence
- ️ Cluster Formation: Auto-join functionality implemented but needs more testing

### Configuration System
-  TOML Configuration: Basic configuration file support
-  CLI Overrides: Command-line parameter support
-  Config Validation: Basic validation with error messages

- Network: Timeout and connection settings
- Storage: Basic RocksDB configuration
- ️ Raft: Consensus timing parameters
- Logging: Log level and format settings
- Cluster: Peer configuration and auto-join settings
- Security: Configuration structure only (TLS not fully implemented)

### Dual-Protocol APIs
-  HTTP REST API: Basic functionality implemented

-  Log Management: Basic logging only

## Comprehensive Testing Results

### Multi-Node Cluster Testing
```
Single Node: Full operations and configuration tested
2-Node Cluster: Leader election and replication validated
3-Node Cluster: Extensive automated testing (HTTP, TLS, mTLS)
Auto-join: Automatic cluster formation working reliably
TLS Encryption: End-to-end HTTPS communication tested
mTLS Authentication: Mutual certificate authentication working
Real Process Testing: Tests with actual ferrium-server binaries
Larger Clusters: 5+ node clusters not tested
Network Failures: Partition recovery not thoroughly tested
Extended Load: Long-running high-throughput testing needed
```

### Known Issues
- Auto-join reliability needs improvement
- Error messages could be more helpful
- Configuration validation is basic
- Network error handling is minimal
- Performance is not optimized

## Quick Start (Development Only)

### Single Node Testing
```bash
# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Generate basic config
./target/release/ferrium-server --generate-config ferrium.toml

# Start single node (development only)
./target/release/ferrium-server --config examples/configs/single-node.toml
```

### Basic Cluster Testing
```bash
# Start first node
./target/release/ferrium-server --config examples/configs/cluster-node1.toml
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:21001/init

# Start second node (will attempt auto-join)
./target/release/ferrium-server --config examples/configs/cluster-node2.toml

# Test basic operations
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"Set":{"key":"test","value":"hello"}}' \
http://127.0.0.1:21001/write
```

## ️ Usage Disclaimer

Ferrium is currently beta software suitable for:
- Development and testing environments
- Learning about distributed systems
- Non-critical production workloads (with proper testing)

- Contributing to open source
- Internal tools and services
- Staging environments

Use with caution for:
- Mission-critical production workloads (needs extended testing)
- High-availability systems requiring 99.9%+ uptime
