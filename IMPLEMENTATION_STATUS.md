# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Generate basic config
./target/release/ferrium-server --generate-config ferrium.toml

# Start single node (development only)
./target/release/ferrium-server --config examples/configs/single-node.toml
```

### Basic Cluster Testing
```bash
# Start first node
./target/release/ferrium-server --config examples/configs/cluster-node1.toml
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:21001/init

# Start second node (will attempt auto-join)
./target/release/ferrium-server --config examples/configs/cluster-node2.toml

# Test basic operations
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"Set":{"key":"test","value":"hello"}}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:21001/write

## ⚠️ **Usage Disclaimer**

**Ferrium is currently beta software suitable for:**
- Development and testing environments
- Learning about distributed systems
- Non-critical production workloads (with proper testing)
- Proof of concept and prototype projects
- Contributing to open source
- Internal tools and services
- Staging environments

**Use with caution for:**

- High-availability systems requiring 99.9%+ uptime
- Large-scale deployments (>5 nodes not extensively tested)
- Financial or security-critical data (thorough security audit recommended)

**Ferrium should NOT be used for:**
- Systems where data loss is catastrophic without backup/testing
- Applications requiring sub-millisecond latency guarantees
- Environments without proper monitoring and operational procedures
